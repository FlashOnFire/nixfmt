# `nix-format`

WARNING: This tool is a work in progress. It probably isn't useful yet, but
you're welcome to contribute.

`nix-format` is a tool to enforce a uniform style across Nix codebases. It's
driven by [hnix][]. Unfortunately, hnix doesn't keep newline and comment
information yet, so this information is currently lost. We're working on this.

If you want to help, begin with implementing [hnix#57][].
